Quiz Application using Django
Project Name: Smart Quiz System
Project Description:
This is a simple Quiz App project made using Python and Django. This application allows students to choose from four subject:
C
Python
JavaScript
Java
In this app, when a student selects a subject, they will see 30 multiple choice questions (MCQs). Each quiz has a 20-minute timer.
If the student finishes before the time, they can click Test Completed.
If the time ends, the quiz will be submitted automatically and show “Time’s up.”
After the quiz ends, the student will see their score and also which answers were correct or wrong.
Wrong answers will show a cross, and correct answers will show a tick.
The student can choose to go to the next subject or end the quiz.
If possible I will also try to make the PDF report of the result downloadable
Teacher (Admin) Side:
The teacher will log in as Admin in Django. The teacher can:
Add subjects.
Add questions with 4 options and the correct answer.
See which students have joined and attempted the quiz.
See the students’ results.
The technologies that I have used are:
Backend: Python, Django
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for timer)
Database: SQLite (default Django database)
If possible the reports will be generated and downloaded as PDF with free libraries
